# Open Disciplines
[Open Disciplines](https://opendisciplines.com/) is dedicated to enhancing transparency by curating and providing information on disciplinary actions taken against healthcare workers. Our primary objective is to serve the public, regulatory bodies, healthcare organizations, and researchers with better data on disciplinary actions.

Open Disciplines aggregates disciplinary action data from all provinces in Canada and states in the United States. This information is then standardized, cleaned, and published to the public via OpenDisciplines.com, offering a simple API and bulk downloads upon request.
